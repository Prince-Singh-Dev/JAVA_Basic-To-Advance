# JAVA – Introduction

1. What is Java?

Java is a high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (1995) and now maintained by Oracle.
It is used to build web, desktop, mobile, and enterprise applications.

2. Key Features of Java

Simple – Easy to learn, similar to C/C++.
Object-Oriented – Everything is based on objects and classes.
Platform Independent – Write once, run anywhere (WORA).
Secure – No pointer, strong memory management.
Robust – Handles errors using exception handling.
Multithreaded – Can perform multiple tasks at once.
Portable – Same bytecode runs on any OS.
