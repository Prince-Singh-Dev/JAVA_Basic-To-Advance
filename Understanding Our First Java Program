👉 Basic Structure of a JAVA Program

1. Functions : Block code that performs a specific task , helps in code reusability and modularity 
2. Classes   : It is a blueprint or template used to create objects 

👉 CODE :

package com.company; 

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("Hello World !");
    }
}

👉 Breaking down the CODE : 

---- public class Main {

>> Here , we are declaring a class named Main which is publicly accessible.

---- package com.company;  

>> A package in JAVA is used to group related classes. Think of it as a folder in a file directory

---- puclic static void main(String[] args){ 

>> public is the access specifier 
>> the static keyword here specifies that the code will execute without building its object
>> the void is return type means the code will not return anything after its execution
>> the main() method is the entry point into the application ; code snippet inside this will be executed

👉 Naming Conventions

>> For classes we use PascalConvention : Every First letter of the word included in sentence is in capital letters 
   for example : mynameisprince -- (In PascalConvention) -- MyNameIsPrince
>> For functions we use camelCaseConvention : First letter is lower else all words coming furthur will have Capital letter
   for exmaple : mynameisprince -- (In Camel Case Convention ) -- myNameIsPrince

>> Examples : 
    ____________________________________________________________________
   |  Normal Sentence  |  Pascal Convention   | Camel Case Convention   |
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
   |  add two numbers  |  AddTwoNumbers       | addTwoNumbers           |
   |  Naming           |  Used in Classes     | Used in Functions       |
   |___________________|______________________|_________________________|

👉 To comment a JAVA code : Use // double slashes , interpreter will ignore this line while the execution of the code 

>> For example :  //Hii This is a Comment Line.
