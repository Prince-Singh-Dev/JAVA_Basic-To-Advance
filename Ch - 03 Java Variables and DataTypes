👉 Anatomy of a Java Program : 

A Java program is typically structured into several logical sections.
Some sections are mandatory, while others are optional depending on the program’s requirements.

_____________________________________________________

1. Documentation Section (Optional but Recommended)

This section contains comments that describe the program.
It improves readability, maintainability, and collaboration.

Usually Includes:

Author name
Date of creation
Purpose of the program
Brief description of the logic

For example : 

/*
 Author: Prince Singh
 Date: 05-02-2026
 Purpose: Demonstrate basic structure of Java program
 Logic: Takes input and prints output
*/
_____________________________________________________

2. Package Statement (Optional)

The package statement defines the namespace of the class.
It is used to group related classes and interfaces into a single unit.

Foe example : package com.mycompany.project;

Key Points:

Helps in organizing large projects
Avoids name conflicts
Must be the first line of code (after comments)
_____________________________________________________

3. Import Statements (Optional)

Import statements are used to access predefined classes from Java libraries or user-defined packages.

Example: import java.util.Scanner;

This allows the program to use the Scanner class for user input from keyboard.

Key Points:

Reduces the need to write fully qualified names
Improves code clarity and readability
_____________________________________________________

4. Interface Statement (Optional)

Interfaces define a contract that classes must follow.
They are used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance.

This will be covered in detail in later chapters.

Example:

interface Animal {
    void sound();
}
_____________________________________________________

5. Class Definition (Mandatory)

The class is the core building block of a Java program.
All variables and methods are defined inside classes.

Example:

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello Java");
    }
}

Key Points:

Every Java program must have at least one class
The class containing main() is the entry point
File name must match the public class name
